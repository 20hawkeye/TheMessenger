# The Messenger

An open source messenger implementation; tribut to "some old, lost messenger friend lists out there"... 
used as the main inspiration with the following program.

Built on the very appealing "QT Creator" IDE, to be released under the "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (3)"... the application promisses to be slick, community oriented, and "perhaps" full of personality.

* Soon to be at "beta testing" release stage... only a few procedures left... at around a few dozen functions so far.

Technical specs:

* simple server / client / sql / smtp
* regional server support
* openssl stand alone encryption ( ... )
* hashed and rehashed passwords standard

About the code:

* at working methodes stages
* one developer for now _ feel free to apply for a collaboration


There are some parts that rely on a series of scripts... these are included into the distribution, along with an sql db template.
The scripts are basicly related to encryption with openssl and send mail via gmail account.
For the Gmail sendmail we need to have php pear mail installed and an application password generated withing gmail settings.
