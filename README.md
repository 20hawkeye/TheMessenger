# The Messenger

An open source messenger implementation; tribut to "some old, lost messenger friend lists out there"... 
used as the main inspiration with the following program.

Built on the very appealing "QT Creator" IDE, to be released under the "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (3)"... the application promisses to be slick, community oriented, and "perhaps" full of personality.

* Soon to be at "beta testing" release stage... only a few procedures left... at around a few dozen functions so far.

Technical specs:

* simple server / client / sql / smtp
* regional server support
* openssl stand alone encryption ( ... )
* hashed and rehashed passwords standard

About the code:

* at working methodes stage
* one developer for now
