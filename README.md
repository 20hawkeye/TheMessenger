# TheMessenger

An open source messenger implementation; tribut to "the many messenger friend lists"... 
used as main inspiration for the following program.

Built on a very strong "QT Creator" foundation, to be released under the "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (3)"... the application promisses to be slick and "perhaps" full of personality.
