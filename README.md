# TheMessenger

An open source messenger implementation; tribut to "the many messenger friend lists"... 
used as main inspiration for the following program.

Built on the very appealing "QT Creator" IDE, to be released under the "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (3)"... the application promisses to be slick and "perhaps" full of personality.

* Soon to be at "beta testing" release stage...

Technical specs:

* regional server support
* openssl stand alone encryption ( ... )
