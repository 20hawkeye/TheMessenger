The Messenger

An open source messenger implementation; aimed at replacing Yahoo Messenger... used as the main inspiration with the following program.

Built on the very appealing "QT Creator" IDE, to be released under the "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (3)"... the application promisses to be slick, community oriented, and "perhaps" full of personality.

   

Technical specs:

    simple server / client / sql / php smtp
    regional server support intended
    openssl stand alone encryption ( ... ) *** updated to standard ssl socket
    hashed and rehashed passwords standard *** ...

About the code:

    at working methodes stages *** a bit better now ...
    one developer for now _ feel free to apply for a collaboration // join the project: rgb.trust@gmail.com

There are some parts that rely on a series of scripts... these are included into the distribution, along with an sql db template. The scripts are related to encryption with openssl and send mail via gmail account. For the Gmail sendmail we need to have php pear mail installed and an application password generated withing gmail settings.

*** not any more, but still <sql> db and <php> sendmail included
*** server requires <php pear mail>
